# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# user = User.create!(
#   email: "test@test.com",
#   password: "password"
# )
# projects = 20.times.map do
#   Project.create!(name: Faker::Educator.unique.subject, user: user)
# end
# projects.each do |project|
#   20.times do
#     Task.create!(name: "read #{Faker::ProgrammingLanguage.unique.name}",
#       project: project, priority: rand(0..2), due_date: Faker::Date.forward(days: 23))
#   end
